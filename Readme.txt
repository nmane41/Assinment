In this we are using client server application to send the encrypted file over the network.

To do encryption and decryption we have used RSA asymmetric key algorithm.

1. Write python file to generate the public and private keys(key_generation.py)
2. Run key_generation.py file.
3. Run new_server.py
4. Run new_client.py
5. File will be sent from client to the server.
