In this project we have implemented simple understanding file handling.
We are creating new files by reading the incremental data from one file.
If we add data in test.log file and save it, it will create new file with newly added data.
For our understanding we have used loop for 10 incremental data(so that 10 files will get created at the end of program
provided we need to add data into test.log file).
To start with we need to run Testing.py module.
